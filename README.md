### bpy.vim

A simple vim plugin created to make posting to Blogger or Wordpress more comfortable.

### Requirements

The plugin needs the b.py package installed and configured beforehand.

### Posting

The plugin will look for the file *brc.py* in the directory containing the current file and all upper directories until it finds one. To post the current file just type

```
    :Post
```

For more information on configuring the b.py package take a look at [http://pythonhosted.org/b.py/](http://pythonhosted.org/b.py/).
